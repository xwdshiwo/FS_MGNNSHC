Code of paper Feature Selection of Microarray Data Using Multidimensional Graph Neural Network and Supernode Hierarchical Clustering 

For reviewers to review

The current version of the code is not fully curated. We present the core code and examples for reviewers to review. The full code will be published with the final version of the paper.

You can achieve this by running the main.py script, which creates a graph-structured dataset with two types of relationships to perform feature selection and classification tasks.
